 Scientific studies of physics at high energies typically involve characterizing
 the results of colliding beams of particles at relativistic speeds, which
 offer far more control and detail compared to fixed target experiments
 or astronomical observations.

The behavior of fundamental particles in the smallest scales are described
 using quantum field theory (QFT), where their behavior is described using
 eigenstates of a field theory.
 While free fields admit trivial eigenstates, appearance of coupling terms
 in the Lagrangian typically require eigenstates in the form of a perturbation
 series.
 Computing scattering amplitudes to arbitrary accuracy require computation
 of higher order terms of higher complexities and typically require Monte
 Carlo-based numerical methods [].
 Each such term/process in the series can be illustrated in terms of Feynman
 diagrams- while most such processes are well/understood, exceedingly small
 fractions of them involve exotic particles or new physics within as well
 as beyond what's known as the Standard model (SM) of particles.

Explain how standard Monte Carlo based generators like Pythia accurately
 sample particle collisions from 1st principles.
 Combining with detector simulators like Geant4 accurately reproduce expected
 particle hits on the detector.
 However, this is too slow and cause pile up for higher energies and luminositie
s.
