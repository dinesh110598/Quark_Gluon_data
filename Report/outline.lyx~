\begin_layout Section
Introduction and Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current work, we build and study a generative model based on graph
 variational autoencoders to accelerate simulations of boosted top quark
 production in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 While it trains on dataset obtained from existing Monte Carlo-based generation
 and detector simulation models, we aim to accelerate re-sampling the same
 without compromising on the accuracy and fidelity.
 A successful implementation of the model can be used to program customized
 FPGA-based triggers that can avoid pile-up of unnecessary background hits
 during collision experiments at the LHC.

Tracker is the innermost series of finely segmented silicon wafers that
 (non-destructively) detect positional tracks left by particles formed from
 a collision beam, deciphering practically nothing about their energies.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pixels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the Tracker are labelled using 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z,\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\rho,\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 for the barrel and endcap sections respectively- where 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 denotes length along the axis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 denotes the perpendicular radius and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 denotes the azimuthal angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surrounding the Tracker is the ECAL subdetector which captures the incoming
 photons and electrons, and measures their energies using scintillating
 lead tungstate crystals.
 In the barrel section, it is segmented by pseudorapidity 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(i\eta_{EB}\right)$
\end_inset

 and azimuthal angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(i\phi_{EB}\right)$
\end_inset

 and spans within 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\eta\right|<1.479$
\end_inset

 making it a 
\begin_inset Formula $170\times360$
\end_inset

 grid of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pixels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The endcap is labelled using 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(iX,iY\right)$
\end_inset

 as a Cartesian grid of pixels arranged in a circle.
 Psudorapidity is an alternative to the polar angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 frequently used in spherical coordinates and they're related by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=-\ln\left[\tan\frac{\theta}{2}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The HCAL subdetector encloses the ECAL and measures the energies of hadronic
 particles (mostly charged pions and kaons) using scintillating brass towers.
 The barrel section encloses the pseudorapidity range 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\eta\right|<3$
\end_inset

.
 The pixels in the barrel section of HCAL produce an image that's more coarsely
 segmented with roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 computations of physical quantities observed in high energy experiments
 are performed.
 In particular, the values of Green's functions or S matrices determine
 the various scattering 
\emph on

Hard scattering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The

hard scattering
\emph default
 component probes the smallest length scales around the collision center.
 The cross sections are usually determined using ab inito (first principle),
 perturbative QFT calculations at the highest order of accuracy feasible
 in terms of the coupling constants.
 Terms of the perturbation series can be represented visually using Feynman
 diagrams
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and their values are often plagued by problems with IR divergences in loop
 integrals which often cancel analytically with tree-level counterparts.
 If analytic solutions are not available, Monte Carlo-based simulations

 are used for which there are ever-increasing quests for improvements in
 efficiency and numerical stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Secondary interactions and decays
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since detectors are present at much larger distances from the center, there
 can be additional collisions and decays beyond the hard scattering which
 need to simulated accurately.
 Factorization theorems

 give rise to correlations between the momenta of partonic (quarks/gluons)
 currents of different flavours, which are encoded semi-classically as integrals
 of parton distribution functions (PDF).
 Their time-evolution is modelled using Monte Carlo-based algorithms like
 parton showers

Numerical libraries and open simulated datasets

\begin_layout Standard
Many generic software libraries that simulate parts of the event generation
 chain we briefly summarized are available.

 and PYTHIA

 They're run in combination with software that simulate the behavior of
 particular detectors (in say, CMS) like GEANT
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 While the Monte Carlo-based generators are highly accurate, they often
 scale poorly with the collision energy, luminosity and detector count.
 Faster detector simulation libraries like DELPHES
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 tend to make approximations that trade off accuracy for speed.
 Full simulation of collider experiments using theory-driven collision event
 generators and experimentally optimized detector simulators is referred
 to as end-to-end event generation.

\begin_layout Standard
Generative networks
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 are machine learning tools used to sample from a learned data distribution
 from the training set.
 While Monte Carlo generators asymptotically (in the limit of infinite samples)
 converge to the actual distribution for averaged quantities, they can suffer
 from large autocorrelations between successive samples and poor accuracies
 for non-averaged quantities for practically finite number of samples
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "metropolis_mcmc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, most generative ML models sample with no autocorrelations
 but their asymptotic closeness to the target distribution depends on the
 model architecture, training parameters, loss function and the quality
 of training data.
 Most popular classes of generative networks include variational autoencoders
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 (VAE), generative adversarial networks
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 (GAN) and normalizing flows (NF)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Normalizing_flows"

\end_inset

.
 VAEs and GANs generally offer highly expressive models and have already
 been used in many high energy physics applications including end to end
 event generation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ML_LHC_events_review"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 NFs are known to be less expressive but allow us to explicitly compute
 likelihoods of different samples and can be inverted for reverse simulations,
 which have been exploited in many HEP applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Variational autoencoders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VAEs use neural networks to 
\emph on
encode
\emph default
 or compress high dimensional input data to lower dimensional latent space
 which is also the parameter space for an easily sampled probability distributio
n (like Gaussian) and these samples are then 
\emph on
decoded
\emph default
 by other neural networks back to the original input space.
 They are typically trained to minimize a distance between the input and
 the (decoded) output data, like mean squared error (MSE), along with a
 prior likelihood term into an evidence lower bound (ELBO) estimator.
 In our work, we use graph-based neural networks for encoders and decoders
 in a VAE, an idea which has already been explored

Graph convolution and pooling operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the geometric deep learning framework
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bronstein2017geometric"

\end_inset

, we tend to use operations that preserve the structure and symmetries of
 the input data.
 In the case of graph data, we'd like to preserve the neighborhood of each
 node and require that the output be invariant to permutations within the
 neighborhoods.
 Spectral convolutions
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 were initially developed as compatible operations on graph data but they
 tend to scale poorly with the number of nodes and edges.
 Message passing layers like GCN 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

and SAGE
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 were developed to compute convolutions in polynomial time on the size of
 input data.
 We convert the sparse detector image by taking the non-zero pixels as nodes
 and putting edges between 
\emph on
k 
\emph default
nearest neighbors (knn) of every node.
 We use SAGE convolution layers, which is ideal for aggregating information
 from the neighborhood of every node when the edge count 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sim k\right)$
\end_inset

 is very small.
 The operation is mathematically described using
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bm{x}'_{i}=\bm{W}_{1}\bm{x}_{i}+\bm{W}_{2}.\text{agg}_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}\bm{x}_{j}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{W}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{W}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are weights of the layer (which are optimized during training) and 'agg'
 is an aggregating operation like mean or max.
